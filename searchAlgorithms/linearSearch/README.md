# Linear Search

> CS50 Explanation

Is an algorithm used to find an element in an array.

* In linear search, the idea of the algorithm is to iterate across
the array from left to right, searching for a specified element.

### In pseudocode:
* Repeat, starting at the first element:
  * If the first element is what you're looking for (target), stop.
  * Otherwise, move to the next element.

Worst/Best case:

* O(n)
* &#937;(1)
