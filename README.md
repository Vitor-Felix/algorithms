# A review of Algorithms, Data Structures & Design Patterns

1. Try to implement these things, only by their general concepts. 
2. Search for better approachs.
3. Search for different solutions for the specific language.

### Elected languages

For fun I choose to implements with four languages that i liked to work with.

* ![](./assets/icon_c.svg)

  * for having a language to work with more low level concepts.
* Java 
  * for having a strong OOP approach, mainly for the Design Patterns.
* JavaScript 
  * for being the more dynamic (and volatil) language that I know.
* Python 
  * for the pseudocodish way of writing at its shallow level, but also having cool facilitators when you know more about the language.
